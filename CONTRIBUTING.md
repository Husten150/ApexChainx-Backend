## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- Use **TypeScript** for all new files
- Follow **React hooks** best practices
- Use **functional components** over class components
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling (no inline styles)
- Use **shadcn/ui** components when available
- **Extract reusable logic** into custom hooks
- **PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces** for all components

**Example:**
```typescript
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

interface WalletConnectProps {
  onConnect: (publicKey: string) => void;
}

export function WalletConnect({ onConnect }: WalletConnectProps) {
  const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
  
  // Component logic here
  
  return (
    <Button onClick={handleConnect}>
      {connected ? 'Disconnect' : 'Connect Wallet'}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** for all functions
- Write **docstrings** for all public functions
- Use **async/await** for I/O operations
- **Pydantic models** for request/response validation
- **Dependency injection** for services
- **Environment variables** for configuration

**Example:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from app.models.payment import PaymentCreate, PaymentResponse
from app.services.stellar.payment_service import PaymentService
from app.api.deps import get_current_user

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/payments", response_model=PaymentResponse)
async def create_payment(
    payment: PaymentCreate,
    current_user = Depends(get_current_user)
) -> PaymentResponse:
    """
    Create a new payment transaction on Stellar network.
    
    Args:
        payment: Payment details including amount and destination
        current_user: Currently authenticated user
        
    Returns:
        PaymentResponse with transaction hash and status
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If payment creation fails
    """
    service = PaymentService()
    result = await service.create_payment(payment)
    return result
```

### Smart Contracts (Rust/Soroban)

- Follow **Rust best practices**
- **Document all public functions**
- Use **proper error handling**
- **Test all functions** thoroughly
- Keep **gas costs** in mind
- Use **clippy** for linting

**Example:**
```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl SLAContract {
    /// Calculate SLA result for an outage
    /// 
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `outage_id` - Unique identifier for the outage
    /// * `severity` - Severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    /// * `mttr_minutes` - Mean time to repair in minutes
    /// 
    /// # Returns
    /// SLAResult containing status and payment information
    pub fn calculate_sla(
        env: Env,
        outage_id: Symbol,
        severity: Severity,
        mttr_minutes: u32,
    ) -> SLAResult {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

## 📚 Documentation Guidelines

- Use **clear, concise language**
- Include **code examples**
- Add **screenshots** for UI features
- Keep **up-to-date** with code changes
- **Link to related docs** where helpful
- Use **Markdown** for formatting

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Security is everyone's responsibility. Follow these guidelines strictly.**

### Secret Management
- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, private keys, passwords, tokens) to version control
- Use **environment variables** or a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for sensitive data
- **Never log secrets** or include them in error messages, stack traces, or documentation
- Use **separate secrets** for each environment (dev/staging/prod)
- **Rotate secrets** regularly and immediately after any suspected compromise

### Authentication & Authorization
- Always use **bcrypt** for password hashing (never plaintext or weak hashes)
- Implement **rate limiting** on auth endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
- Use **token rotation** for refresh tokens to detect replay attacks
- Follow the **principle of least privilege** for all API endpoints
- Validate **role-based access** on every protected endpoint

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Validate all inputs** using Pydantic models with strict type checking
- Enforce **payload size limits** to prevent abuse (see MAX_REQUEST_BODY_SIZE_BYTES)
- **Sanitize user inputs** before storage or processing
- Use **parameterized queries** for database operations (SQLAlchemy handles this)
- Implement **CORS policies** that restrict allowed origins

### Blockchain & Wallet Security
- **NEVER expose Stellar secret keys** (starting with 'S') in code, logs, or docs
- Only use **public keys** (starting with 'G') for wallet linking and balance queries
- **Separate testnet and mainnet keys** - never reuse across environments
- Use **hardware security modules (HSM)** or secure enclaves for production key storage
- Implement **transaction validation** before submission (amount, destination, asset type)

### Webhook Security
- Always **verify webhook signatures** using HMAC-SHA256 before processing
- Implement **idempotency** to prevent duplicate webhook processing
- Use **HTTPS** for all webhook endpoints
- Validate **webhook payload structure** before acting on events

### Audit Logging (BE-010)
- **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, secret keys)
- Include **actor attribution** (user ID/email) in all audit events
- Add **correlation IDs** to track requests across services
- Audit logs are **immutable** - never modify or delete audit entries
- Redact sensitive fields automatically using the audit service's sanitization logic

### Code Review Security Checklist
Before approving any PR, verify:
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in code or comments
- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Auth checks are present on protected endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Audit logging captures security-relevant events

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Do not push directly to `main` — all changes must go through a PR
- Do not commit `.env` files — use `.env.example` for documentation
- Do not add floating version ranges to `requirements.txt` — pin exact versions
- Do not put business logic in route handlers — it belongs in services
- Do not expose private keys via API responses or logs
- Do not skip tests — all PRs require passing test suite

---

## Reporting a Bug

When filing a bug report, include:

1. **Steps to reproduce** — the exact sequence of actions
2. **Expected behaviour** — what should have happened
3. **Actual behaviour** — what actually happened
4. **Environment** — Python version, OS, database version
5. **Logs** — relevant error output (redact any secrets)

---

## Proposing a Feature

Before opening a feature request:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Describe the problem the feature solves — not just the solution
3. Consider the scope: does this belong in the backend, frontend, or contracts?
4. Outline acceptance criteria — what does "done" look like?

---

## Code Review Expectations

- PRs are reviewed within 48 hours on business days
- Address all reviewer comments before requesting re-review
- Use `Resolve conversation` only after the concern is addressed, not to dismiss it
- Breaking changes require explicit sign-off from a maintainer

---

## Documentation-only PRs

PRs that only modify `.md` files do not require test coverage but must:
- Be factually accurate and consistent with the routed runtime
- Not introduce references to legacy module paths or old names
- Follow the same commit convention as code PRs

---

## Test Coverage Expectations

- New service functions must have at least one unit test
- New route handlers must have at least one integration test
- Bug fixes must include a regression test that would have caught the bug
- Tests must pass locally before opening a PR (`pytest tests/`)

---

## Dependency Management

This project uses `pyproject.toml` for declaring dependencies with `pip-tools` for lock file generation.

### One-command bootstrap
```bash
make bootstrap
```

### Updating dependencies
```bash
pip-compile pyproject.toml --generate-hashes > requirements.lock
```

### Installing from lockfile
```bash
pip install -r requirements.lock
```

---

## Database Migration Guidelines

When your PR requires a database change:

1. Create a new migration file under `alembic/versions/` with the next sequential number
2. Name the file descriptively: `NNNN_short_description.py`
3. Include both `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions
4. Test the migration with `alembic upgrade head` and `alembic downgrade -1`
5. Include the migration in the same PR as the code that depends on it

---

## Security Review Checklist

Before submitting a PR, verify:

- [ ] No secrets, keys, or credentials in any committed file
- [ ] No private keys exposed via API responses or logs
- [ ] Input validation present on all new endpoints (Pydantic schemas)
- [ ] Authentication required on all protected routes
- [ ] No new floating dependency version ranges
